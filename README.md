# Library Book Database

Techdegree Unit 8 Project

SQL, Sequelize, Static, Node.js and Express Site

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this project was to create an application for a local library to help them manage their collection of books in a more intuitive way. Librarians can list, add, update, and delete books in this library application. This was creating using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize. I was able to learn how to implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence. This is the final project for Unit 8 of the Treehouse Techdegree.

**Challenges:**
My challenges included working with the asyncronous codes and communicating with the database. But, I learn how useful it is to refer to the documentation whenever possible.

**Furture Considerations:**
In the future, I would like to include a search field for the books listing page to make searching for available books more easier. Search should work for all of the following fields: Title, Author, Genre, Year. It would also be useful to include pagination for the books listing page.
